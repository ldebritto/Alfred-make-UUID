# Alfred-make-UUID
This is a workflow for the excellent macOS app Alfred (https://www.alfredapp.com)

The workflow is no more than a shortcut for the bash command `uuidgen`.

## Added in this fork
An option to create the UUID from a text snippet straight into the current text box (default is `;uuid`) 

# Installation
- Download the .workflow file from the releases page.

# Credits
- Forked from @ethanweed/Alfred-make-UUID
- Heard of this bash command first from a [MacPowerUsers Forum post](https://talk.macpowerusers.com/t/569-contextual-computing/21153/36) by user [@knowuh](https://talk.macpowerusers.com/u/knowuh)
